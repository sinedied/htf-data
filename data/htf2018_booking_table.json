Un synthÃ©tiseur et une boÃ®te Ã  rythme Korg Electribe. Il fait son premier pas dans la crÃ©ation musicale en sâ€™inspirant de la DnB pour ses compositions. Puis en 2008, il fait sa premiÃ¨re prestation Ã  la fÃªte de fin dâ€™annÃ©e du lycÃ©e dâ€™art.\r\n\r\nEn 2011, Vincent commence le mix en faisant principalement de la DnB. Il commence la Progressive Trance en 2012 , peu avant la crÃ©ation du crew Â« Namek Sound Ravâ€™olution Â» dont il est le vice-prÃ©sident. Le Crew doublÃ© dâ€™un Sound System est centrÃ© sur la culture psychÃ©dÃ©lique.\r\n\r\nEn 2015, Vincent commence la production musicale sur ordinateur. Quelques mois plus tard, Insonitus Records lui propose dâ€™intÃ©grer le label basÃ© en Angleterre. Depuis cette date, Vincent a installÃ© son studio traitÃ© acoustiquement. Il a jouÃ© une trentaine de fois son projet Dark-Prog. 5 releases sur ces 3 ans dont une pour le Hadra Festival oÃ¹ Vincent va jouer en 2018. Reconnaissant dâ€™avoir pu Ã©tendre ses performances, au-delÃ  du grand Est de la France, au Luxembourg, Ã  la Belgique, Ã  la NorvÃ¨ge et Ã  la Suisse.\r\n\r\n\r\nVincent a crÃ©Ã© son propre style Ã  la sauce psychÃ©dÃ©lique et organique. Ayant diverses influences dans le monde musical, il vous fait rentrer dans son univers, mÃ©langeant des gros rythmes groovys, des sonoritÃ©s mentales et psychiques tout en gardant des touches de la musique prÃ©-techno.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\f\r\nVICIOUS CACTUS (ENGLISH)\r\n\r\nVicious Cactus is Vincent T.â€™s psychedelic music project created in 2015.\r\nThis projects brings together several cultures : Techno, Dark Progressive Trance and Hip-Hop / Bass Music.\r\n\r\nBorn in the Northeast of France, at the border between France, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg, Vincent discovers a taste for electronic music while attending to a concert of Noisia, the pioneer of Drum &amp; Bass, at a festival in Nancy.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Vincent receives his first machines. A synthesizer and a Korg Electribe drum machine. His first step in musical creation is inspired in its composition by DnB. Then, in 2008 comes his first performance at the end of year party of the Art high school.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Vincent starts to get into mixing, making mostly DnB. He tackles Progressive Trance in 2012, shortly before the creation of the â€œ Namek Sound RAVâ€™olution â€œ crew, where he acts as vice-president. The Crew, coupled with a Sound System, is centered around psychedelic culture.\r\n\r\nIn 2015, Vincent starts computer-assisted music production. Some months later, Insonitus Records offers him to join the England-based label. Since then, Vincent has installed his acoustically-treated studio, and played his Dark-Prog project thirty times. 5 releases these three last years, including the one for Hadra Festival, where Vicious Cactus is invited to play at the 2018 edition. Lucky enough to have been able to extend his performances beyond the great East of France, to Luxembourg, Belgium, Norway and Switzerland.\r\n\r\n\r\nVincent created his own style, with a psychedelic and organic feel. Having diverse influences from around the musical world, he gets you introduced to his Universe, mixing fat, groovy rhythms to mental and psychic sonorities while still hinting at pre-techno music.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------",

Born and raised in Denmark, he has been involved with music one way or another since his late teens. First as a bass player at the age of 17, but the introduction to Psychedelic Trance lead to him ditching his bass and getting into computers and synthesizers. Fast forward a couple of years and the project Grapes of Wrath was born. Together with his partner in crime Jaffa they were on a mission to make harder edged music than most were doing at the time. This culminated in the seminal split album with Meteloids: â€œTits on Fireâ€ Released on Parvati Records in 2004 and considered a milestone release for that label. Since 2006 Monno has mainly released music as Onkel Dunkel and his second album â€œConnectionsâ€ Was released in June 2017. Comprised of only tracks with friends that came for a visit in the studio, itÂ´s a mix of influences spanning far and wide. \r\n\r\nAfter a busy winter he is now back in the studio working on new material to keep your synapses firing at maximum. \r\n\r\nBest enjoyed loud in mild climates, no expiry date.",

Olli has been a pioneer of Psychedelic Trance for many years &amp; Space Tribe is one of the most well known names in the psychedelic scene thanks to his incredible energy &amp; music. For over 20 years heâ€™s been globe trotting in his unique style â€“ delivering mind bending, full power psychedelic music &amp; raising clouds of dust\r\nIn 1993, Olli, his brother Miki, and fellow space cadet, Richmond, started Space Tribe clothing in Bali. The fractal fluoro party gear was an instant success, and now you can see it at parties all over the planet.\r\nIn 1995, the first Space Tribe tracks were hatched in the Butterfly studios with Simon Posford (Hallucinogen/Sphongle), and everything flowed from there. Space Tribe released the first album, 'Sonic Mandala' on Spirit Zone in 1996. In 2004 Space Tribe Music was set up as a record label providing an outlet for Space Tribe releases &amp; compilation albums. Space Tribe are also making many tracks in collaboration with other artists â€“ Mad Maxx, GMS (Alien Jesus), X-Dream, Electric Universe (ESP), Tristan, Dick Trevor (Green Nunâ€™s of the Revolution) . Jon Klein (Specimen, Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees,) has also been bringing his sublime guitar skills to Space Tribe live shows &amp; in the studio. Today, Space Tribe continue to travel all over the world, playing live at parties and bringing joy to the thousands of dancers who know exactly why they are there. Space Tribe parties have lifted the spirit and tweaked the synapses all over the planet from Burning Man to Ozora, from the mountains in Japan to the beach in Goa..Next party?\r\nMaybe on Sirius B?",

After a while, I tried to cure myself by cooking my own beats and also quickly learn how to use turntables.\r\n\r\nSince my first party behind the decks in 2009, I have been blasting all kind of imaginable dancefloor: forest, club, squat, beach, church, jungle, boat, castle, mountain, resort or bunker, and shared the stage with all of my favourite artists around the world. \r\n\r\nMy debut album &quot;Smoking Skills&quot; was finally released in 2018 on World People Prod, after one EP, one chill album and more than 15 tracks on different VA's... So much more to come!\r\n\r\n= FRANCAIS =\r\n\r\nAprÃ¨s avoir tapÃ© plus de 10 ans sur une batterie et formÃ© plusieurs groupes allant du mÃ©tal au funk en passant par le hip hop, jâ€™ai fini par mâ€™intÃ©resser Ã  la synthÃ¨se sonore vers 2008. Et au mix dans la foulÃ©e. \r\n\r\nCâ€™est avec le collectif Bruxellois Elektro Magnetik que jâ€™ai fait mes dÃ©buts, avec un premier dj set en 2009 et mon tout premier live en 2010.\r\n\r\nDepuis, jâ€™ai eu la chance de faire pÃ©ter mes sons sur une flopÃ©e de dance floors complÃ¨tement barrÃ©s: Ã©glise, chateau, squat, forÃªt, jungle, plage, montagne, volcan, bateau, safari parc, bunker, et de partager rÃ©guliÃ¨rement le line up avec les artistes qui mâ€™ont toujours inspirÃ©s. Ici ou lÃ : Belgique, France, Allemagne, Pays-Bas, Suisse, Portugal, Ibiza, Croatie, Italie, SlovÃ©nie, Hongrie, Russie, Roumanie, Lituanie, Mexique, Guatemala, Inde et mÃªme Luxembourg..\r\n\r\nCâ€™est finalement chez World People Prod quâ€™est sorti monÂ premier album psy, Â«Â Smoking SkillsÂ Â», en 2018, aprÃ¨s un EP et un album Chill chez Green Tree Rec, et plus de 15 tracks sur diverses compilations.\r\n\r\nOn est sur du twilight, groovy forest, autour des 148-150 bpm, avec un flow hypnotique et des lignes de basses massives, enveloppÃ©es dans des textures qui chatouillent, tantÃ´t Ã©lastiques, tantÃ´t corrosives. \r\n\r\nA dÃ©couvrir bientÃ´t: des collabâ€™s avec, entre autres, Virtual Light, Synthetic Chaos, Phase, Chakraview, Wood Warden,â€¦",

As a dj he has played in many parties and festival around the world together with lots of artists of international fame in the world of trance. From the point of view of his musical choice, he doesnâ€™t like sticking to just one style of psy-trance, but he prefers to adapt his set to the hour, the people and the situation he finds himself in, taking always special care of the mixing. When playing during the night hours, he usually offers a Psychedelic Trance oriented style, with very psychedelic sounds which try not to degenerate into maddening noise or too dark influences; in the morning hour he will more likely choose to play more full-on underground stuff, trying to remain within the borders of psychedelics but with softer sounds, more suited for the light. Anyway he would rather play at dawn, according to him the most suitable moment of the day to enjoy his best sets. His djset is full of unreleased stuff .\r\nHe founded Looney Moon records with a group of friends in 2008 and he's is the label manager and dj of the label. Nowadays Looney Moon Records is a very weel known music label  with 5 killer compilations , 4 albums and lots of digital EP which bombed the dancefloors around the world.",

After several attempts in the period of 1988-1993, he moved for good to north America in 1996 with a full CD bag of Goa Trance classics. Shortly after meeting organizers in Quebec, he spinned in after hours, clubs and raves all around the place. He was also making backdrops to decorate places, hand painted t-shirts and always had a kiosk to sell CDâ€™s. After having spinning for 4 years and organizing â€œNaturaâ€ wonderful parties with his brother, he settled up his first music studio in 1999 using Reason 1.0 and Acid 3.0 to start to make music with Khetzal and make some remixes from well known bands like Juno Reactor.\r\n\r\nDJ Zen created Altar Records in 2010. He's the manager and owner of the label since then. He does DJ and live sets on demand and does mainly all artwork and audio mastering for Altar Records. His music production as Astral Waves has gathered him some praise in the psychill scene as well as the numerous compilations he has done for Altar and diverse labels.",

The compilation was an instant hit topping the psytrance chart on Beatport and the CD chart at PsyShop.com.

    "bio": "Last time i played in the Hadra altrnative stage it was at Hadra festival first edition in Chorges Hautes Alpes and back then i played a chill out and downtempo djset. Played several more times in the Hadra mainstage but super happy to make it back int he alternative, after 13 years and with some different music. This time gonna treat u with a glitchy experimental to techno set which i've been working on in the past few years. I find this music super inspiring and i'm gonna show you the best of the collection i digged in many years of research. This is gonna be my first techno set at a festival and i'm very much looking forward to this new experiecnce. You can expect some super fat &amp; cunky basslines, solid production and very long and neat mixes.",
